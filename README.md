# Golden Goals Expense Tracker
Simple expense tracker that is meant to allow clients the chance to input their income and any expenses they may have, in order to track their spending. Data is saved to localStorage, so no account is needed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js

Originally created a base app with Vanilla JavaScript for a client, where the goal of the project was to create a small web app meant for their customers that could help them track their income and expenses in a simple way. I decided to use Vue.js and the composition API to create a more modern and simple design that was more in line with best practices. 


## Lessons Learned:
I had ideas to set up a database, which could store a client's account credentials, but later decided to keep it simple and use localStorage. This project could have gotten a lot more complicated through the use of oAuth authentification, allowing multiple user profiles on an account, among many other ideas that were floated around during the initial design period, but we decided the focus for this web app to simply be an easy stepping stone to helping customers achieve financial literacy and introducing them to simple methods to help them keep track of their financial habits.
